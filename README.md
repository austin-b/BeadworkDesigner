# Beadwork Designer

An attempt at a Python-based desktop application for designing loom-based [beadwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beadwork), also known as [beadweaving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead_weaving). In the future, I plan on expanding the design templates to other pattern types. 

Other applications around similar concepts have not been nearly as satisfying to myself or have the breadth of features that I one day hope to have on this application, including easily-readable save files (currently json), a variety of export options for easy-to-use print copies, and high-abstraction editing options to allow fast and creative idea generation on this particular medium.

*NOTE: this is an extremely early version that is filled with bugs and not-yet-implemented features. Please be nice*

### How to Run

1. download the project
2. launch the Python virtualenv from within ./.venv/Scripts
3. run `python BeadworkDesigner.py` or `python BeadworkDesigner.py --help`

### Screenshots

*These will come later when I've polished up the UI more, sorry.*

### Dependencies

Currently, the only dependencies are PySide6 
& pytest.
