### List of features to add

- [x] make a Goals/Ideas/Features file
- [x] add Save As file menu action

    - [x] OR: load default_project.json, but not allow Save, only Save As (determine via non-existent title field?)

- [x] Settings menu
    - [ ] font options
    - [x] add a way to change the size of the beads

- [ ] add a way to change the color of the background
- [ ] add a "bucket fill" option/tool

    - turns out it was all the log entries that I have now commented out
- [x] implement undo and redo functionality

- [x] add different levels of logging (so that DEBUG doesn't give EVERYTHING, but that another level will)
- [ ] add different types of beads: 
    - Delica sizing (type I use is DB style): https://www.miyuki-beads.co.jp/english/seed/09.html
    - have types/classes of beads that know their dimension, for calculation and to automatically set the ratios for bead height and width displayed?
    - any way to get available colors for the types of bead chosen?
    - multiple bead types in one project?
- [ ] add padding at the end of the bead view for aesthetic purposes, as when you add enough beads to scroll, it will stop at the end
